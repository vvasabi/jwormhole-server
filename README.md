# jWormhole Server

This is a JVM- and SSH-based localhost tunnel tool.


## Differences from other localhost tunnel solutions

* There is no commercial SaaS offering based on this tool, so there is no pay-walled feature.
* This is JVM-based, so it can be embedded into any other JVM applications. (This is why I created
  jWormhole in the first place.)


## Features

* User authentication is done via sshd.
* Support the ability to specify custom host name.


## Requirements

* Java 8 (due to the use of Lambda expressions)
* Running sshd
* Servlet container


## Installation

* Compile with `mvn package`.
* Create a configuration file (see the next section).
* Run the .war file with a servlet container, such as
  [Jetty Runner](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Howto/Using_Jetty_Runner).
* Set up a wildcard A record for the domain to be used.
* **Optional**: set up SSL if desired (through reverse proxy or servlet container)
* For installation of jWormhole client, see
  [jWormhole Client](https://github.com/vvasabi/jwormhole-client) repo.


## Configuration

Below is the default configuration. Create a file at $HOME/.jwormhole/server.properties with the
following content. Uncomment options that need to be overridden.

```
# Domain name
#jwormhole.server.domainNamePrefix =
#jwormhole.server.domainNameSuffix = .example.com

# Port to access controller; must not be within the host port range
#jwormhole.server.controllerPort = 12700

# Random host port range; must be >= 1024 and < 65535
#jwormhole.server.hostPortRangeStart = 20000
#jwormhole.server.hostPortRangeEnd = 30000

# Number of characters of generated host keys; must be > 0
# Note that this does not limit the number of characters that a custom host name can have.
#jwormhole.server.hostNameLength = 5

# Time to drop inactive hosts in seconds; must be > 0
#jwormhole.server.hostTimeout = 60

# Time to garbage collect inactive hosts; must be <= hostTimeout and > 0
#jwormhole.server.hostManagerGcInterval = 20

# Forward client IP
#jwormhole.server.ipForwarded = false

# User agents shouldnâ€™t send the url fragment but what if it does?
#jwormhole.server.urlFragmentSent = true
```
